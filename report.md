## Overview/Report

 This project was an implementation of the min-max algorithm with alpha beta pruning in a tic tac toe game, to create    unbeatable machine opponenet. To briefly review, min-maxxing is a type of adversarial search algorithm that, specifically in this implementation, goes through a tree of possible plays in the tic tac toe game, and evaluates the advantages resulting from choosing a certain set of moves. A simulated game with a higher rating means it holds a higher advantage for the computer player, while a lower "min" rating holds an advantage for the enemy player. Alpha beta pruning is a modification to the min-max algorithm, that dramatically speeds up the run time by eliminating the need to search useless branches by comparing them to the current min and max paths searched. In the creation of my code, I heavily referenced Kylie Yings Tic Tac Toe solution, mainly due to trouble on visualizing the creation of a tic tac toe board in a terminal environment, as I am more familiar with creating game boards in languages such HTML and CSS. Regardless, one major bit of trouble I had while developing was understanding the algorithm, as I have little to no familiarity with searching algorithms beyond that of BFS and DFS. On top of that, I also had trouble understanding how to implement alpha beta pruning, which is when I referenced the video above by Sebastian Lague. Upon the implementation of alpha beta pruning in the program, I noticed an increase in response times during each of the computer's turn, with the longest response time being less than 1000ms, and only occurs at the beginning of the game in the case that the human player has gone first. A simple explantion for why this happens is because, since it is the beginning of the game, there is more possible moves to be made, meaning the algorithm would take slightly longer to go through and choose the most efficient route.One thing that I implemented on top of the source code was commenting to explain what each piece of the function is doing, which greatly aided in my understanding of the program as I could always reference back when needed. Future improvements that could be added to the project is an implementation in a webpage, which I intend to go back on and do in typescript as I already have created an ai tic tac toe project in typescript. Other improvements include a score system to keep track of wins, and reset button so the player can restart a game that is already losing, and animations to create a more interactive game that could be implemented with GUI styling. Last but not least, the screenshots that display the program fully functioning are held inside the github repository, labeld Game1.png and Game2.png. The first screenshot displays a normal game occuring between the player and the algorithm, as the computer predictably wins against the player, with basic game functionality being displayed. The human user can interact and place their symbol on the board by choosing a number that represents an open spot on the board that is not already filled in, and any number outside of the bounds of the game throws an error. Each turn is correctly labeled to the player, a vicotry is displayed at the end of each game, and prompt asks if the player wants to play again. In the case that the player chooses to input a character outside the binary "y/n", the program simply registers it as an "n" and ends the game. The second screenshot displays much of the same, as it is simply a run through of the game where the machine remains victorious against the player
